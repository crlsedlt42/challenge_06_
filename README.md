# 5-Day Weather Forecast for Traveling

## Description

As a webstack developer who enjoys to travel while working remotely, it is important to know the weather conditions of a new location.
This app allows me to use an Application Programming Interface (API) to interact with information provided by another developer/company to illustrate the weather of a requested city.
